This is the prelimnary map work I’ve done on the dataset.  I took a look at the spray data and saw that we only really have data for 2011 and 2013.  Based on this, I just made a subset of the weather for each of those years (weather2011, weather2013). I also made spray subsets as well (spray2011, spray2013)

The four html files are the maps of the 2011 Spraying Locations, the 2013 Spraying Locations, All Spraying Locations (Clustered), and All Spraying Locations (Raw)

Let me know how it looks and what kinds of feature you think I should add
